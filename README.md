**`Full stack developer, 3D modeler, and pet lover üê∂üê±`**

Hi, I'm Alejandro!! I'm a new full stack developer, content creator, and knowledge sharer with a diverse set of skills and experiences. As an Industrial Production Engineer and Business person with experience in sales and leadership, I have a strong understanding of how to manage teams and execute projects in a way that is efficient and effective.

In addition, I'm also a director/co-owner of a furniture factory business, which has given me valuable experience in managing resources and building a strong team. This skillset can be extremely useful as I work on coding projects and create content.

As someone who enjoys coding, cooking, and creating, I have a unique perspective and creative approach to problem-solving. In addition to my skills as a full stack developer, I'm also skilled in 3D modeling. I enjoy creating 3D models and using them to solve real-world problems and bring my ideas to life.

Outside of work, I'm a pet lover and owner of 2 dogs and 2 cats. I understand the importance of care, attention, and love, and I apply these values to my work as a full stack developer and content creator. My empathy and understanding help me build strong relationships with my audience and community, making it easier for me to connect with others and share my knowledge and experience.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. I'm always eager to learn and grow, so don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Alejandro's Coding/Life Journey</h3></summary>
   I started programming at the age of 8 motivated by my father who teach me this world, coding small scripts with BASIC to solve my math homework (coders always choose the automated path). At 13, I began to learn HTML and I discover the CMS tools... so I started building personal websites and blogs using Joomla. As I continued to learn, I discovered WordPress, which allowed me to build websites for the family business, while also selling the first computers that I had built in high school.

After high school, I briefly pursued (2 years) a degree in Mechatronic Engineering (here I learn some Python and C++) before switching to Industrial Production Engineering to be closer to the family business and continue the work that I had started at the age of 15. Since then, I've contributed to the company in various ways, including developing several versions of their website, with the most recent 2023 version focused on e-commerce using Shopify and some customizations that I have made.

In 2015, I developed a traceability label generator site using PHP and QR generators, which is still in use today. Additionally, I designed and implemented a screen system that functions like informational flight boards at airports, displayed throughout the manufacturing plant with signage display systems... btw I have network management knowledge and I manage the NAS backup servers.

Alongside my coding love, I've also developed strong 3D modeling skills using SolidWorks (for which I hold a certification), SketchUp and Blender (on the way). I use these skills to bring my ideas to life and solve real-world problems, both in my personal projects and business.

In addition, I have experience in website hosting and domain administration, which has given me a well-rounded understanding of web development and helped me provide a more complete range of services to my clients.

Today, as a content creator and knowledge sharer, I enjoy sharing my coding/life journey with others and helping aspiring developers get started. I believe that anyone can learn to code, and that with determination and hard work, anyone can succeed in the tech industry.

Thank you for joining me on my coding journey, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow with you!
